# Space Travel History Challenge by Maven Analytics(Linkedin)

This project focuses drawing insights from a dataset containing all space missions or travels from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission.

## Challenges :

▻ No significant challenge as the dataset was clean. One of my favorite projects I've ever worked on was by far this one. My mind was spinning when I first looked at the dataset since there were so many questions I could use it to address.

## Insights:
▻ The United States spends the most on space travel.

▻ Of all the space travel companies, RVSN USSR has embarked on the most missions.

▻ The Cosmos-3M (11K65M) is the most commonly used kind of rocket for space travel.

▻ About 89% of all space travel is successful.
